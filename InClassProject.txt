During spring, Bob was helping Farmer Pickles in the fields with his (Bob's) team.

A backhoe named "Scoop" was the tool used as part of making the fence. Scoop was happy to help make the fence.

After they made the fence, they took a break.

Then they all had a moment, "Scoop" said "What a beautiful spring day it is!".

Bob said that he wanted to play "hide-and-seek".
